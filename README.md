# Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard



![screenshot of application](/screenshot.PNG)


I have created a weather dashboard using server-side APIs. When the user inputs a city name in the form then they are presented then the dashboard with current and future conditions for that city. That city is added to the search history along with spots for 10 other cities. When the user views current weather conditions for that city then they are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. The user can view future weather conditions for that city and will be presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity.N I click on a city in the search history. Finally when the user leaves the application and comes back the search history will be saved in local storage.
